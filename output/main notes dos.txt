With DOS Version 5 and later you can hide data files by applying the +H (hidden) attribute. -H removes the hidden attribute.
 The +S (system) and -S options are generally used by programmers to hide and unhide command files used only by DOS. 
After applying the hidden or system attribute to a file, it will not appear in a directory listing unless you specifically
request it with the /A parameter of the DIRECTORY command.
