# AKIRA-SYSYEM-SECURED-VAULT

# PROBLEM ???

In this current pandemic scenario most of the users are using their pcs to do their work and store important files related to their work, projects and accounts.
Even kids around age of 5-16years are downloading lots of important files through internet and exploring their world of education. 
we are unable to secure those  files and  folders. we don’t have any proper authenticated system to secure all those files. 

# example
If a 8 years kid using his father’s company laptop to play games, by accidentally if he delete any important files of project work it may cause large burden to his father
